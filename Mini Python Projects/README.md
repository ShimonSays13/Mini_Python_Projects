ENVIRONEMT SETUP: MS VISUAL STUDIO CODE

PROJECT 1: PIG GAME

Players will get a turn whereby they will roll a dice. Whatever value they get other than 1 will be added to their previous score. Once players get value 1, that turn will automatically become 0, therefore no value will be added to the score. So players will have to take risk on when they will want to stop their turn. Whichever player reaches the maximum score value of 50 will win.

PROJECT 2: MADLIBS GENERATOR

A user will be given a story and there will be some words that are mussing from thr story. These words can be replaced by the user based on the catgegory of words that they want to insert, for example [noun, adjective, verb]. Once this is done the words that were requested will then be used inside the story. 

PROJECT 3: TIMED MATH CHALLENGE QUIZ

Randomly generated math questions are given for the user to answer. The user will have to answer all of the questions correctly so that they will be able to complete the quiz. If their answer is wrong then they will need to redo the same math question until they get it right before proceeding to the next question. Once the user completes the quiz, their time will be recorded in seconds.
