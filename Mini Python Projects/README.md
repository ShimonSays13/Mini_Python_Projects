ENVIRONEMT SETUP: MS VISUAL STUDIO CODE

PROJECT 1: PIG GAME

Players will get a turn whereby they will roll a dice. Whatever value they get other than 1 will be added to their previous score. Once players get value 1, that turn will automatically become 0, therefore no value will be added to the score. So players will have to take risk on when they will want to stop their turn. Whichever player reaches the maximum score value of 50 will win.
